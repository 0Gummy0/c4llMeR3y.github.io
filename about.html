      <h1>Hi!, I’m Reynald Sanchez Bismanos</h1>
      <p>
        I’m an IT student who’s passionate about programming, games, and interstellar space. 
        This page shares a bit more about who I am, what I like doing, and my journey as a student.
      </p>
      <p>
         Playing online games on my computer and mobile phone is the only hobby that I have.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have vast knowledge about outerspace, galaxies, and other thing that is related to it. I was very interested with it since I was in my 5th grade where I had my very first phone. Later on, I found my passion for coding through a game called "Minecraft", in the game, there's a block that lets you put specific command that can almost do anything you imagine, and thats where the spark for choosing this course was born. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In my 7th grade, I already knew how to build a system unit by watching countless computer builds and tips from the content creators I came across in the social media apps.
      </p>
      <p>Later on, I choose the ICT strand in senior high school years and learned a lot of skills, it also helped me build leadership skills since I was always incharge of everything back then. Joining the ICT-CSS strand helped me support my knowledge about computers by getting certificates every assessment we performed and now possessing a NC 2 certificate makes me even more confident about my skills.
